Web app (17.5):
Simple calculator that allows user to add/remove 4 items.
Implemented coupon.
Possible improvements: Allows for adding in new items
                       Calculate tax as well.

Web report (25.5): 
Did some comparisons between web technologies, better to divide into front-end/back-end technologies comparisons.
Talked about database briefly.
Adding some more in-depth analysis for factors such as performance, scalability, maturity of the language would be great.

Web CI/CD (bonus) : 0


Mobile app (17):
Similar design as the web app. 
It only works on iOS 14 and above.
Layout of the app can be improved a bit (cannot dismiss keyboard when entered coupon, coupon is not applied, item shifts after expanding the drop down menu, tax not expressed in percentage).


Mobile report (24):
Had some comparisons between iOS/Android/Flutter (comparison is mainly based on familiarity and community support).
Adding some more in-depth analysis for factors such as performance, scalability, maturity of the language would be great.
